# library Decoder

This is a set of Solidity codes. At the very beginning, it defines a library and a contract. The library `Strings` provides utility functions for manipulating string data types, while the contract `Context` is an abstract contract that other contracts can inherit from to gain access to context information about the current transaction.

The `Strings` library provides the following functions:

`toString`(uint256 value): Converts an unsigned 256-bit integer to its string representation.

`toString`(int256 value): Converts a signed 256-bit integer to its string representation.

`toHexString`(uint256 value): Converts an unsigned 256-bit integer to its hexadecimal representation.

`toHexString`(uint256 value, uint256 length): Converts an unsigned 256-bit integer to its hexadecimal representation, padded to a certain length with leading zeroes.

`toHexString`(address addr): Converts an Ethereum address to its hexadecimal representation.

`equal`(string memory a, string memory b): Checks whether two strings are equal.

The `Context` contract defines two internal view functions:

`_msgSender`(): Returns the address of the account that sent the current transaction.

`_msgData`(): Returns the data payload of the current transaction.

Another library `Address` provides several low-level functions for working with Ethereum addresses, including:

`isContract`(address account): Checks whether an address corresponds to a contract or an externally-owned account.

`sendValue`(address payable recipient, uint256 amount): Sends a certain amount of ether to a specified address.

`functionCall`(address target, bytes memory data): Calls a contract function without transferring any ether.

`functionCall`(address target, bytes memory data, string memory errorMessage): Calls a contract function without transferring any ether and returns an error message if the call fails.

`functionCallWithValue`(address target, bytes memory data, uint256 value): Calls a contract function and transfers a certain amount of ether.

`functionCallWithValue`(address target, bytes memory data, uint256 value, string memory errorMessage): Calls a contract function and transfers a certain amount of ether, returning an error message if the call fails.

`functionStaticCall`(address target, bytes memory data): Calls a contract function without changing the contract state.

`functionStaticCall`(address target, bytes memory data, string memory errorMessage): Calls a contract function without changing the contract state and returns an error message if the call fails.

`functionDelegateCall`(address target, bytes memory data): Calls a contract function using the delegatecall opcode.

`functionDelegateCall`(address target, bytes memory data, string memory errorMessage): Calls a contract function using the delegatecall opcode and returns an error message if the call fails.

Last but not least, the `Base64` library is used to encode binary data as a `Base64` string. It consists of a single function, encode, which takes a bytes type argument and returns a string type value.

The implementation of the encode function is based on a lookup table that maps the binary values to their Base64 equivalents. The table is defined as a constant string within the library.

The function uses Solidity's assembly block to perform low-level operations. It first calculates the length of the resulting Base64 string and allocates memory for it. Then, it loops through the binary data in chunks of 3 bytes at a time and encodes them as a 4-character Base64 string. If the input data is not a multiple of 3 bytes, the function pads the output string with = characters as necessary.

Once the encoding is complete, the function returns the resulting `Base64` string. The implementation is efficient and optimized for gas usage, making it suitable for use in Ethereum or any EVM based smart contracts.
